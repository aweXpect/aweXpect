# DateOnly / TimeOnly

Describes the possible expectations for `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly`.

## Equality

You can verify that the `DateOnly` or `TimeOnly` is equal to another one or not:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24);

await Expect.That(subject).IsEqualTo(new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24));
await Expect.That(subject).IsNotEqualTo(new DateOnly(2024, 12, 23));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16);

await Expect.That(subject).IsEqualTo(new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16));
await Expect.That(subject).IsNotEqualTo(new TimeOnly(13, 15, 16));
```

You can also specify a tolerance:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24);

await Expect.That(subject).IsEqualTo(new DateOnly(2024, 12, 23)).Within(TimeSpan.FromDays(1))
  .Because("we accept values between 2024-12-22 and 2024-12-24");
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16);

await Expect.That(subject).IsEqualTo(new TimeOnly(14, 15, 17)).Within(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
  .Because("we accept values between 14:15:16 and 14:15:18");
```

## One of

You can verify that the `DateOnly` or `TimeOnly` is one of many alternatives:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24);

await Expect.That(subject).IsOneOf([new DateOnly(2024, 12, 23), new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24)]);
await Expect.That(subject).IsNotOneOf([new DateOnly(2024, 12, 23), new DateOnly(2024, 12, 25)]);
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16);

await Expect.That(subject).IsOneOf([new TimeOnly(14, 15, 15), new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16)]);
await Expect.That(subject).IsNotOneOf([new TimeOnly(13, 15, 16), new TimeOnly(13, 14, 15)]);
```

You can also specify a tolerance:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 24);

await Expect.That(subject).IsOneOf([new DateOnly(2024, 12, 23)]).Within(TimeSpan.FromDays(1))
  .Because("we accept values between 2024-12-22 and 2024-12-24");
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = new TimeOnly(14, 15, 16);

await Expect.That(subject).IsOneOf([new TimeOnly(14, 15, 17)]).Within(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
  .Because("we accept values between 14:15:16 and 14:15:18");
```

## After

You can verify that the `DateOnly` or `TimeOnly` is (on or) after another value

```csharp
DateOnly subject = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsAfter(new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1));
await Expect.That(subject).IsOnOrAfter(new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsAfter(new TimeOnly(0, 0, 0));
await Expect.That(subject).IsOnOrAfter(new TimeOnly(0, 0, 0));
```

You can also specify a tolerance:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsAfter(DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)).Within(TimeSpan.FromDays(1));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsAfter(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)).Within(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

## Before

You can verify that the `DateOnly` or `TimeOnly` is (on or) before another value

```csharp
DateOnly subject = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsBefore(new DateOnly(2124, 12, 31));
await Expect.That(subject).IsOnOrBefore(new DateOnly(2124, 12, 31));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsBefore(new TimeOnly(23, 59, 59));
await Expect.That(subject).IsOnOrBefore(new TimeOnly(23, 59, 59));
```

You can also specify a tolerance:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsBefore(DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)).Within(TimeSpan.FromDays(1));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsBefore(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now)).Within(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
```

## Between

You can verify that the `DateOnly` or `TimeOnly` is between two values:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject).IsBetween(new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1)).And(new DateOnly(2123, 12, 31));
```

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject)
    .IsBetween(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now).Add(-2.Seconds()))
    .And(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now).Add(2.Seconds()));
```

You can also specify a tolerance:

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now);

await Expect.That(subject)
	.IsBetween(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now))
    .And(TimeOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now))
	.Within(2.Seconds())
  .Because("it should have taken less than two seconds");
```

## Properties

You can verify, the properties of the `DateTime`:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 31);

await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().EqualTo(2024);
await Expect.That(subject).HasMonth().EqualTo(12);
await Expect.That(subject).HasDay().EqualTo(31);
```

You can verify, the properties of the `TimeOnly`:

```csharp
TimeOnly subject = new TimeOnly(15, 16, 17, 189);

await Expect.That(subject).HasHour().EqualTo(15);
await Expect.That(subject).HasMinute().EqualTo(16);
await Expect.That(subject).HasSecond().EqualTo(17);
await Expect.That(subject).HasMillisecond().EqualTo(189);
```

All property verifications support the following comparisons:

```csharp
DateOnly subject = new DateOnly(2024, 12, 31);

await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().EqualTo(2024);
await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().NotEqualTo(2020);
await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().GreaterThan(2023);
await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().GreaterThanOrEqualTo(2024);
await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().LessThanOrEqualTo(2024);
await Expect.That(subject).HasYear().LessThan(2025);
```
